 Project Overview

The Titanic dataset provides information about the passengers on the Titanic. The goal is to build a model that predicts whether a passenger survived based on features like:

- Passenger class
- Sex
- Age
- Siblings/Spouses aboard
- Parents/Children aboard
- Fare paid
- Port of Embarkation


Technologies Used

- *Python 3.10+*
- *Pandas* – for data manipulation
- *NumPy* – for numerical calculations
- *Matplotlib / Seaborn* – for data visualization
- *Scikit-learn* – for machine learning models (Decision Tree, Random Forest)

## Project Files

- main.py – main code to run the model
- titanic.csv – dataset file (input data)
- .gitignore – file to ignore system files and folders
- README.md – this file
- requirements.txt (optional) – install all dependencies with one command
